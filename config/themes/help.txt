Step by step on creating a new theme:
-Copy a theme you would like to branch from
-rename the copy to "test" 

-cd /home/harri/.config/themes
-python3 colorextractor.py 

-Modify the theme_palette.png in /themes to what you want it to be.
-Save the edit as "modified.png"

-python3 replacementgen.py
-./apply_replacements.sh

Done! Rename your new theme to something recogniseable and delete the temporary files:
modified.png, theme_palette.png, replacements.txt
